Players move around, inspect objects and collect items by typing commands into the terminal.\r\n\r\n### Player Commands\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>enter [PORTAL]</li>\r\n  <li>inspect [ELEMENT]</li>\r\n  <li>take [ITEM]</li>\r\n  <li>turn [LEFT, RIGHT, AROUND]</li>\r\n  <li>use [ITEM]</li>\r\n  <li>view inventory</li>\r\n  <li>quit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-hils124/master/Docs/GamePlay2Abandoned.png)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Design Layout\r\n\r\n### Floor Plan\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-hils124/master/Docs/FloorPlanAbandoned.png)\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-hils124/master/Docs/ClassDiagramAbandoned.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Documentation\r\n### abandoned.house\r\nPackage that stores all the classes that form the house:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Rooms</li>\r\n  <li>Walls</li>\r\n  <li>Portals</li>\r\n  <li>Containers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n### abandoned.game\r\nPackage that stores all the game logic and the initial creation of the house itself.\r\n\r\n#### JSON Serialization\r\nThe house is built from a JSON file called *HouseData.json* which holds all the data for each room in the house. *HouseBuilder.java* reads this file in and serializes the information into a java object which it then returns.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nHouse house = mapper.readValue(new File(\"resources/HouseData.json\"), House.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis house contains rooms, walls, portals, and containers that the player can now interact with.\r\n\r\n### abandoned.entities\r\nPackage that stores items and specific actions for each one.\r\n#### Item Actions\r\nItem actions are handled with Java enums found in *EntityUseType.java*. Each item has a parameter *useType* which holds an enum to indicate the item's action.\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> keys -> <em>new KeyAction()</em></li>\r\n  <li> scissors -> <em>new ScissorsAction()</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nEach action class has a *use()* method that is specific to that item. This method is called by item's *use()* method.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n",
